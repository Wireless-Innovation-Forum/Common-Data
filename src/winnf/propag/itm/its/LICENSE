Irregular Terrain Model (ITM) (Longley-Rice) (20 MHz â€“ 20 GHz)

[http://www.its.bldrdoc.gov/resources/radio-propagation-software/itm/itm.aspx]

Abstract: The ITS model of radio propagation for frequencies between 20 MHz
and 20 GHz (the Longley-Rice model) (named for Anita Longley & Phil Rice, 1968)
is a general purpose model that can be applied to a large variety of engineering
problems. The model, which is based on electromagnetic theory and on statistical
analyses of both terrain features and radio measurements, predicts the median
attenuation of a radio signal as a function of distance and the variability
of the signal in time and in space.
